# **COSI 119A - Autonomous Robotics**

Welcome to my repository containing programming assignments for the ROS Robotics course. These assignments are designed to help me develop a practical understanding of mobile autonomous robotics concepts, architecture, and programming using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

# **Learning Objectives**
The assignments in this repository are intended to help me:

Develop an understanding of key mobile autonomous robotics concepts such as localization, state management, mapping and path finding, and sensor fusion.
Learn how to think architecturally within the context of a fully distributed operating system.
Understand how to create small concurrent modules that communicate with each other.
Organize desired functionality and behavior for maximum flexibility and scalability within a distributed operating system.
Develop proficiency in programming with the Robot Operating System (ROS), including understanding of ROS concepts such as nodes, topics, commands and services, concurrency, and distributed operating systems.

# **Assignments**
The assignments in this repository are designed to build on each other and reinforce the concepts covered in the course. Each assignment will require me to write code using ROS and implement a specific robot behavior. The assignments are as follows:

Localization: Implement a robot behavior that uses sensor data to localize the robot within a known map.
Mapping: Implement a robot behavior that maps an unknown environment using sensor data.
Path Planning: Implement a robot behavior that plans a path through a map to reach a specified goal.
Behavior Planning: Implement a robot behavior that plans a sequence of actions to achieve a desired goal, given a high-level task specification.
Each assignment will include a detailed description of the behavior to be implemented, as well as the specific requirements for the code implementation. I am encouraged to work collaboratively and use the resources available to me, including the ROS documentation and forums.
